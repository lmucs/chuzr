# Data Analysis

### The chuzr analyzer reads from the chuzr store and produces a number of excellent reports.

* Things to model:
  * Users who have signed up over a period of time
  * Votes placed over a period of time
  * User who place votes
  

  * Categories of users(demographics) related to categories of products 
      --(partially implemented on very basic/hacked together level, see chord chart)
  * Categories of products heirarchy and their rating
      --(also partially implemented, circle pack)
  * Categories of users who vote most
      --(implemented with tree map)
  * Quantity of categories of users and products on site
  * Product rating by price?
  * product ratings vs sales?
  * user member peroid vs number of votes?
      * Votes per day?
  * Group products by common likes (i.e. People who chose product A are also likely to choose project B)


* Log of work:
* Looking into JS that converts JSON to pretty HTML, trying to clone and fix this: http://json.bloople.net/ to cater to our needs.
* Trying to figure out this fiddle for CSV format
